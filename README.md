# Text-List-Toolbox _IN PROGRESS_
_The script might crash/quit instantly if there's no .txt files found in the current directory when selecting "modify existing file" option_. Tested on windows only.


## Passwd List Generator
Choose between numbers, characters and symbols with a length parameter. It tries to create every possible combination.



## List Cleaner
Removes all numbers, dots and spaces while maintaining the row structure. options coming in the future


## Duplicate Remover
Removes duplicate rows while maintaining the row structure. If the row ends to a space this removes it for some reason, I'll take a look later.


### To do List
- missing functions
- add options to list cleaner
- exit[0] to all menus (return)
